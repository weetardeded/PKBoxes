# PKBoxes
A clientside script for Garry's Mod highlighting players and props with ESP Boxes. Used for the propkill gamemode.

Place in your Garry's Mod lua folder and use "lua_openscript_cl boxes.lua" in the console to run. sv_allowcslua must be set to 1 by the server in order for this to work.
You can run the script anyway if the sv_allowcslua is not set to 1. One google search will get you there.
